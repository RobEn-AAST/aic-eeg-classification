# the code must be reproducable
ask them for reproducibility should we add kaglge installation or rather have all data inside the proejct and submit it as zip
should we have a speicifc file named some specific where? becuase we have trainer.ipynb and hyperparams_tuner and such so which of those should be.. the main thing they run to reproduce our results?

ask about libraries we use how to make them reproducible too, is this process done automatically or by a human like is including the libraies we need in readme.md file and proper instructions on what needs to be ran enough or what is required exactly

set up requirements.txt and virtual environment
get the separate trainer (non optimizer) to run and save checkpoints while going

is using a data normalizer minmax better than zscore?


TODO CANCEL ALL RANDOMNESS
